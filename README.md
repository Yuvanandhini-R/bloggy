• Create a blogging website with home page  
• Use HTML, CSS, JS, React  
• Firebase for Authentication, Database and Hosting

<hr />

If you want to run the app, configure your firebase console with google sign in auth and firestore and analytics, then create a file named `/src/FirebaseConfig.js` and `export` your config.

For Example,  
<code>
<pre>
const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
    authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
    appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
    measurementId: "G-YOUR_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_MEASUREMENT_ID"
};

export default firebaseConfig;
</pre>
